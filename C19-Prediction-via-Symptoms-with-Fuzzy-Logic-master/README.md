## 1. Project Description

The aim of this project was to create an app to predict the possibility an individual is infected by COVID-19 by looking at the external symptoms they exhibit, such as coughing or fever.

To run the project, please download the source code and execute the `main_program.py` file.

## 2. Packages and Libraries Used

- [PyIT2FLS](https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- TKinter

## 3. Setup Instructions

1. Ensure Python 3.7 and PyPI (pip) are installed.
2. Install all the dependencies necessary.
```
pip install pyit2fls
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```
3. Execute the the `main_program.py` file.

## 4. Project Paper
